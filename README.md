# A Deep Learning Approach to Jazz Music Generation
Have you ever wished you could collaborate with the greats of jazz history? With DeepJazz, you can! This Python project harnesses the power of deep learning to generate original and creative jazz compositions, allowing you to jam with an AI that has learned from the masters.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: We've got the beat! DeepJazz can efficiently process MIDI files and convert them into a format that our deep learning models can understand.
- **Model Architecture**: The heart of DeepJazz is its deep learning architecture, which includes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€“ fancy terms for really cool tech that can learn patterns in music.
- **Music Generation**: With a few lines of code, DeepJazz can create brand new jazz compositions that will have you grooving.
- **Pruning and Cleanup**: We've got your back! DeepJazz includes utility functions to ensure the generated music adheres to standard note lengths and removes any repeated or overlapping notes.
- **Rendering**: Once DeepJazz has worked its magic, it can convert the generated music into MIDI files, so you can listen to your AI-generated masterpieces.
